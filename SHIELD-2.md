## Table of Contents

   [TOC]

## 1. Introduction

   This document specifies the Secure Hierarchical Inter-agent Layer
   for Distributed Environments (SHIELD) framework. SHIELD provides a
   comprehensive security architecture for communication between
   autonomous AI agents in distributed, potentially untrusted,
   environments.

### 1.1. Motivation

   The increasing use of autonomous AI agents in distributed systems
   presents significant security challenges. Agents may need to
   communicate and collaborate across organizational boundaries,
   utilizing diverse platforms and potentially adversarial
   environments. Existing security protocols often fall short in
   addressing these challenges, particularly in the face of emerging
   threats like quantum computing.

   SHIELD addresses these challenges by providing:

   *   A zero-trust security model with continuous authentication and
       authorization.
   *   Quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms for secure identity
       and communication.
   *   A hierarchical, layered architecture for defense in depth.
   *   Fine-grained, capability-based access control for managing agent
       permissions.
   *   Secure sandboxing mechanisms for isolating agent execution.
   *   Comprehensive audit and compliance features for monitoring and
       verification.

### 1.2. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 2. Terminology

   This section defines the key terms used throughout the SHIELD
   specification.

   *   **Agent:**  An autonomous software entity that can perceive its
       environment, make decisions, and act to achieve its goals.

   *   **Agent Identifier (AgentID):**  A globally unique identifier for
       an agent, as defined in Section 4.1.

   *   **Capability:**  A transferable, delegatable, and attenuatable
       token that grants specific permissions to an agent.

   *   **Sandbox:**  A restricted execution environment that isolates an
       agent's operations and limits its access to system resources.

   *   **Secure Agent Runtime (SAR):**  The component responsible for
       enforcing security policies within a sandbox.

   *   **Channel:**  A secure communication path between two agents.

   *   **Quantum-Resistant Identity Protocol (QRIP):**  A protocol for
       establishing and managing agent identities using post-quantum
       cryptography.

   *   **Cross-Sandbox Protocol (XSP):** A protocol for securely transferring agents between different sandboxing environments.

   *   **Audit Chain:**  An immutable, tamper-evident log of security-
       relevant events.

## 3. Core Architecture

### 3.1. Design Principles

   SHIELD is built upon the following core design principles:

   1. **Zero Trust:**
       *   No agent, system, or environment is implicitly trusted.
       *   All interactions MUST be continuously authenticated and
           authorized.
       *   Access to resources MUST be granted based on the principle
           of least privilege.
       *   All security protocols and verifications MUST be done with the assumption that components, users, and resources may have already been compromised.

   2. **Hierarchical Security:**
       *   Security controls MUST be organized in a layered structure.
       *   Each layer MUST have clearly defined security responsibilities.
       *   Layers MUST operate independently but cooperatively.
       *   Security failures in one layer SHOULD be contained and
           MUST NOT compromise the entire system.

   3. **Future-Proofing:**
       *   SHIELD MUST use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
       *   The architecture MUST be modular to allow for algorithm
           upgrades and the integration of new security technologies.
       *   Protocols MUST be extensible to support future security
           requirements.

### 3.2. Layer Structure

   SHIELD's architecture consists of the following layers:

   1. **Physical Security Layer (L1):**
       *   Provides the foundation for security through hardware
           mechanisms.
       *   Implementations SHOULD use hardware security modules (HSMs)
           and secure enclaves (e.g., TPM, TEE) where available.
       *   Systems MUST ensure physical isolation of critical
           components.
       *   This layer MAY provide hardware attestation mechanisms.
       *   **Note:** Consider adding a mention of secure boot processes and the need to protect against physical tampering.

   2. **Identity and Authentication Layer (L2):**
       *   Responsible for managing agent identities and authentication.
       *   Implementations MUST use the Quantum-Resistant Identity
           Protocol (QRIP) as defined in Section 4.2.
       *   This layer MUST support multi-signature schemes for
           organizational control over agents.
       *   Provides certificate lifecycle management.

   3. **Secure Channel Layer (L3):**
       *   Establishes and maintains secure communication channels
           between agents.
       *   Implementations MUST use the protocols defined in Section 5.
       *   Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for
           inter-agent messages.

   4. **Capability Control Layer (L4):**
       *   Manages and enforces capability-based access control.
       *   Agents MUST use capability tokens to access resources and
           interact with other agents.
       *   The structure and usage of capability tokens are defined in
           Section 6.
       *   The system MUST provide secure delegation of all agent capabilities, even through multiple tiers, via the Delegation Chain method (detailed in 6.3)

   5. **Sandbox Execution Layer (L5):**
       *   Provides secure runtime environments for agent execution.
       *   Each sandbox MUST implement a Secure Agent Runtime (SAR) as
           defined in Section 7.1.
       *   Sandboxes MUST ensure resource isolation and code
           verification.
       *   Supports secure agent transfer between sandboxes via the
           Cross-Sandbox Protocol (XSP) defined in Section 7.3.
       *   Ensures all agents are verified via the agent's key signature, all security for communications is set up properly (including forward secrecy), and the transferred agent is executed in the new environment prior to completion of handoff.

   6. **Audit and Compliance Layer (L6):**
       *   Provides mechanisms for logging, monitoring, and verifying
           security-relevant events.
       *   All implementations MUST maintain an immutable Audit Chain
           as defined in Section 8.
       *   Supports real-time security monitoring and incident
           response.

   **Interactions Between Layers:**

   The following table illustrates some key interactions between the layers:

   | Layer                 | Interacts With          | Interaction Description                                                                                                                               |

   | Capability Control (L4)| Secure Channel (L3)   | Capabilities may be requested and granted during channel establishment or subsequently over an established channel.                                      |
   | Sandbox (L5)          | Capability Control (L4)| The SAR in L5 enforces capabilities from L4.                                                                                                           |
   | Sandbox (L5)          | Secure Channel (L3)   | The SAR mediates communication using secure channels from L3.                                                                                           |
   | Audit (L6)            | All Layers             | All layers generate audit records that are logged to the Audit Chain in L6.                                                                            |
   | Physical (L1)         | All Layers             | Provides hardware-based security mechanisms that underpin the security of all other layers. For example, using TPM to ensure secure boot of the system. |

## 4. Identity Management

### 4.1. Agent Identity Structure

   An Agent Identifier (AgentID) uniquely identifies an agent within
   the SHIELD framework. Each AgentID MUST be globally unique and
   conform to the following structure (represented as a JSON object):

   ```
   {
       "uuid": "UUID-v4",
       "organization": "String",
       "role": "String",
       "version": "Semver",
       "publicKeys": {
           "primary": {
               "algorithm": "dilithium3",
               "key": "base64_encoded_key",
               "created": "ISO8601_timestamp",
               "expires": "ISO8601_timestamp"
           },
           "secondary": [{
               "algorithm": "String",
               "key": "base64_encoded_key",
               "created": "ISO8601_timestamp",
               "expires": "ISO8601_timestamp"
           }]
       },
       "capabilities": ["Array<CapabilityURI>"],
       "revocationEndpoint": "URI (Format: https://example.com/revocations)",
       "metadata": {
           "creation_date": "ISO8601_timestamp",
           "last_updated": "ISO8601_timestamp",
           "is_stateless": "Boolean"
       },
       "signature": "base64_encoded_signature"
   }
   ```

   *   **uuid:**  A version 4 Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
       [RFC4122] that uniquely identifies the agent.

   *   **organization:**  A string representing the organization or
       entity that created or manages the agent. This field SHOULD
       be used for grouping agents and can be used to implement
       organizational policies.

   *   **role:** A string defining the agent's role or function (e.g.,
       "data_analyzer", "system_monitor").

   *   **version:** A string representing the agent's software version,
       following the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification [SemVer].

   *   **publicKeys:**  An object containing the agent's public keys.

       *   **primary:** The primary public key used for key exchange.
           The algorithm MUST be a NIST-approved post-quantum algorithm as specified in Appendix A. Uses the CRYSTALS-KYBER-1024 algorithm. This primary key, its capabilities, and all associated agent metadata is signed via the agent signature standard defined in section 4.2. The `algorithm` field is **required** and MUST use a standard algorithm name from a recognized set (e.g., IANA COSE Algorithms registry).

       *   **secondary:** An OPTIONAL array of additional public keys
           that can be used for signature verification or other
           purposes. The use of secondary keys for identity-related functions MUST rotate at a cadence no longer than 90-days.

   *   **capabilities:**  An array of URIs representing the initial
       capabilities granted to the agent at creation. These are
       represented by `CapabilityURI` strings which can indicate
       specific capabilities as defined in Section 6. These values are defined within the signed capabilities token, outlined in section 6.

   *   **revocationEndpoint:** A URI pointing to an endpoint that can be
       queried to check the revocation status of the agent's
       identity. **Format:** The URI MUST follow a specific format (e.g., HTTPS) and point to a service that implements a standard revocation protocol (e.g., CRL, OCSP).

   *   **metadata:**  An OPTIONAL object containing additional
       information about the agent.
       *  **creation_date:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the identity was created.
       *  **last_updated:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the identity was last updated.
       *  **is_stateless:** An optional boolean that if TRUE indicates that the agent can maintain a secure session via a handshake.

   *   **signature:**  A digital signature over the entire AgentID
       object (except for the signature field itself), ensuring the
       integrity of the identity. The signature algorithm MUST be a NIST-approved post-quantum signature algorithm as specified in Appendix A. The agent signature algorithm MUST use the CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM-3 algorithm. The signature covers the entire `AgentID` structure, excluding the `signature` field itself.

### 4.2. Quantum-Resistant Identity Protocol (QRIP)

   QRIP governs the creation, management, and verification of agent
   identities. It uses only NIST-approved post-quantum cryptographic
   algorithms.

   *   All key generation MUST use algorithms specified in
       Appendix A.
   *   Key derivation MUST follow a hierarchical deterministic scheme
       based on HKDF [RFC5869] using a standard format like BIP32 or SLIP-0010 for the `derivation_path`. The `context` field in the key derivation process MAY include information about the specific application or domain.
   *   Agent identities MAY support multi-signature schemes. The specific multi-signature scheme (e.g., Schnorr, BLS, or a threshold signature scheme) MUST be specified in the `metadata` of the `AgentID`. Multi-signature policies MUST be defined and enforced through a combination of smart contracts (if applicable) and procedural controls.
   *   Agent identity signatures MUST use approved algorithms (see Section 4.1).

### 4.3. Identity Verification

   Agents MUST verify the identity of other agents before establishing
   secure channels or granting access to resources. Verification involves:

   1. Checking the `signature` field of the AgentID object. The signature MUST have been made using a valid cryptographic algorithm specified in Appendix A.
   2. Verifying that the `signer` of the `signature` field corresponds to either the agent itself or a trusted organization.
   3. Optionally, if secondary keys are used, retrieving additional public keys to ensure their legitimacy.
   4. Retrieving and validating the current set of signing keys from the specified `revocationEndpoint`. These values can also be cross-referenced against a list of revoked certificates. The `revocationEndpoint` MUST point to a service that implements a standard revocation protocol (e.g., CRL, OCSP). The response from the revocation endpoint MUST include a `status` field indicating whether the agent is `valid`, `revoked`, or `unknown`. It MAY also include a `proof` of the agent's revocation status (e.g., a proof of inclusion in a CRL or a proof of non-revocation from an OCSP responder).

   Agents SHOULD cache verification results for a limited period to
   improve performance, taking into account any specified expiration in the AgentID or any information retrieved from a potential revocation list.

## 5. Secure Channels

   Secure channels provide confidential and authenticated communication
   between agents.

### 5.1. Channel Establishment

   Before establishing a secure channel, agents MUST mutually
   authenticate each other using the identity verification process
   described in Section 4.3.

   The channel establishment process follows these steps:

   1. **Initiation:** The initiating agent sends a `ChannelInit`
       message to the receiving agent. The structure of this message
       is as follows:

       ```
       {
           "initiator": "AgentID",
           "responder": "AgentID",
           "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp",
           "initiator_nonce": "base64_encoded_random_bytes",
           "responder_nonce": "base64_encoded_random_bytes",
           "session_parameters": {
               "proposed_duration": "uint32_seconds",
               "cipher_suites": [{
                   "key_exchange": "kyber1024",
                   "signature": "dilithium3",
                   "encryption": "aes256gcm",
                   "mac": "hmac-sha3-256"
               }],
               "capabilities": ["Array<CapabilityURI>"]
           },
           "signature": {
               "algorithm": "dilithium3",
               "value": "base64_encoded_signature"
           }
       }
       ```

       *   **initiator:** The AgentID of the initiating agent.
       *   **responder:** The AgentID of the receiving agent.
       *   **timestamp:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the message was created.
       *   **initiator_nonce/responder_nonce:**  Separate random nonces generated by the initiating and responding agent. These MUST be at least 32 bytes (256-bits) to help mitigate the risk of replay attacks.
       *   **session_parameters:** Proposed session configuration information.
           *   **proposed_duration:** Number of seconds the agent is requesting to be the channel's length of validity.
           *   **cipher_suites:** An ordered list of cipher suites supported by the initiating agent. Each cipher suite specifies the algorithms to be used for key exchange, digital signatures, encryption, and MAC. Cipher suites MUST only include NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms. Algorithm names MUST follow a standard format (e.g., IANA COSE Algorithms registry).
           *   **capabilities:** An optional array of capability URIs that the initiating agent is requesting for the duration of the session. This is based on any capability requirements detailed by the responding agent. If capabilities are requested that the responding agent is unable to verify or the agent doesn't recognize, the channel will not be established. **Note:** Capabilities are handled in a separate message *after* the channel is established to avoid overloading `ChannelInit`.
       *   **signature:**  A digital signature over the entire `ChannelInit` message, created using the initiating agent's private key.

   2. **Response:** If the receiving agent accepts the channel
       request, it responds with a signed message containing:
       *   The chosen cipher suite.
       *   A newly generated nonce (included in the `responder_nonce` field).
       *   A signature over the response message, including the received `initiator_nonce` value.

   3. **Key Exchange:** Both agents perform a quantum-resistant key
       exchange using the agreed-upon key exchange algorithm from the
       chosen cipher suite. This results in a shared secret key. The specific key exchange algorithm (e.g., Kyber) MUST be specified in the `cipher_suites`.

   4. **Verification:** Both agents verify each other's signatures
       using the public keys associated with their AgentIDs.

   If any of these steps fail, the channel establishment MUST be
   aborted. If successful, a secure channel is established using
   the agreed upon parameters and keys.

### 5.2. Session Management

   Each secure channel is associated with a unique session, identified by a `session_id`. The `SessionConfig` structure defines the session parameters:

   ```
   {
       "session_id": "UUID",
       "created": "ISO8601_timestamp",
       "expires": "ISO8601_timestamp",
       "rekeying_policy": {
           "time_interval": "uint32_seconds",
           "message_count": "uint32",
           "data_volume": "uint64_bytes",
           "explicit_request": "Boolean"
       },
       "perfect_forward_secrecy": {
           "enabled": "Boolean",
           "mechanism": "ECDHE"
       }
   }
   ```

   *   **session_id:**  A UUID that uniquely identifies the session.
   *   **created:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the session was
       created.
   *   **expires:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the session
       expires. This value MUST be derived from when the agent signature will expire, or when that key is set to expire based on that agent's revocation policies (whichever is sooner).
   *   **rekeying_policy:**  Defines when session keys should be
       regenerated. Any of the three conditions (`time_interval`,
       `message_count`, `data_volume`) being met will trigger
       rekeying. If rekeying is required, all prior keys associated with that agent will be destroyed. Rekeying operations are to be done per the specification outlined in 5.1 and re-verification of identity per 4.3 will be done prior to resuming an established channel after the re-key operation. The policy also includes `explicit_request` which, if set to `true`, allows either agent to initiate a rekeying by sending a `rekey_request` message.
   *   **perfect_forward_secrecy:** Configuration information to define perfect forward secrecy standards on this particular session. If `enabled` is TRUE, then the agents MUST utilize ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) or DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) to further ensure key security. If using X3DH, elaborate more on how the one-time prekeys are managed within the context of SHIELD.

   Session keys MUST be derived from the shared secret using a
   cryptographically secure key derivation function, such as HKDF
   [RFC5869].

   Agents MUST NOT reuse session keys for different sessions. Session keys are destroyed on session end or on agent deletion/revocation. Agents MUST discard any stored information associated with an ended session, including nonces, timestamps, etc.

   **Session Termination:** Sessions can be terminated in the following ways:

   *   **Expiration:** When the `expires` timestamp is reached.
   *   **Rekeying Failure:** If rekeying fails.
   *   **Explicit Close:** Either agent can send a `session_close` message to terminate the session.
   *   **Agent Revocation:** If one of the agents involved in the session is revoked.

### 5.3. Message Format

   All messages sent over a secure channel MUST conform to the following format:

   ```
   {
       "header": {
           "sender": "AgentID",
           "recipient": "AgentID (Optional or Session AID)",
           "session_id": "UUID",
           "sequence": "uint64",
           "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp",
           "message_type": "String",
           "encryption": {
               "algorithm": "aes256gcm",
               "iv": "base64_encoded_iv (96-bit random value for AES-GCM)",
               "auth_tag": "base64_encoded_tag"
           }
       },
       "payload": "base64_encoded_encrypted_data",
       "mac": {
           "algorithm": "hmac-sha3-256",
           "value": "base64_encoded_mac"
       }
   }
   ```

   *   **header:**  Metadata for the message.
       *   **sender:** The AgentID of the sending agent.
       *   **recipient:** The AgentID of the receiving agent. This field MAY be omitted or replaced with a Session AID for privacy, especially in multi-agent scenarios.
       *   **session_id:** The UUID of the session associated with this
           channel.
       *   **sequence:** A monotonically increasing sequence number,
           unique per session. Sequence numbers protect against replay attacks and help detect missing or out-of-order messages. Sequence numbers are verified upon receipt, with incorrect sequence numbers leading to message failure and record logging. If the sequence number is close to overflowing or has already overflowed, the sending agent will need to perform session key renegotiation.
       *   **timestamp:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the
           message was created. Define acceptable clock skew (e.g., +/- 5 minutes).
       *   **message_type:** A string indicating the type of message
           (e.g., "command", "response", "event", "capability_grant", "rekey_request", "session_close"). A comprehensive set of standard message types MUST be defined in Appendix B.
       *   **encryption:**  Information about the encryption algorithm.
           *   **algorithm:**  The encryption algorithm used (e.g.,
               "AES-256-GCM"). The encryption algorithm used for agent communications is defined per agent, based on which agent initially set up the secure channel as described in section 5.1 Channel Establishment. If a new channel is set up with that agent, and the agent's preferred algorithm has changed or been deprecated, that same standard will apply.
           *   **iv:** The base64 encoded initialization vector (IV) or
               nonce. This will vary based on the chosen encryption algorithm. For AES-GCM, it MUST be a 96-bit random value.
           *   **auth_tag:** The base64 encoded authentication tag
               generated by the authenticated encryption algorithm.

   *   **payload:** The base64 encoded, encrypted message payload (the ciphertext).

   *   **mac:**  A Message Authentication Code (MAC) computed over the
       entire message (header + ciphertext) using the "Encrypt-then-MAC" approach. This ensures message integrity and authenticity. The MAC algorithm MUST be a NIST- approved algorithm as specified in Appendix A.

## 6. Capability Control

   SHIELD uses a capability-based access control model. Agents use
   capability tokens to authorize actions and access resources.

### 6.1. Capability Token Structure

   Capability tokens MUST be formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
   [RFC7519] and signed using a NIST-approved post-quantum signature
   algorithm. The following claims are REQUIRED:

   ```
   {
       "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams", "https://w3id.org/security/v2", "https://shield.dev/v1"],
       "id": "urn:uuid:unique-capability-id (Resolvable URI)",
       "controller": "AgentID",
       "invoker": "AgentID",
       "parentCapability": "URI",
       "capability": {
           "type": "URI (Resolves to capability type definition)",
           "actions": ["Array<String>"],
           "target": "URI",
           "scope": ["Array<String>"]
       },
       "constraints": [{
           "type": "String",
           "parameters": "Map<String, Any>"
       }],
       "proof": {
           "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
           "created": "ISO8601_timestamp",
           "verificationMethod": "URI (Resolves to public key)",
           "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation or assertionMethod",
           "proofValue": "base64_encoded_proof"
       }
   }
   ```

   *   **@context:** An array of URIs providing context for the capability token, in this instance pointing to the latest security standards version from w3, as well as any custom values for the SHIELD framework. This helps identify this document as a ZCAP-LD based structure, to simplify machine-readability. The `https://shield.dev/v1` context MUST define the SHIELD-specific vocabulary used in capability tokens (e.g., the capability types, actions, constraint types).
   *   **id:** A unique URI identifying this capability token. This URI SHOULD be resolvable to the capability token itself.
   *   **controller:** The AgentID that created the capability. The `controller` is often the same as the `issuer` of the JWT.
   *   **invoker:** The AgentID that can invoke this capability.
   *   **parentCapability:** An optional URI for tracking delegated capability sets. This value is populated when a new set of capabilities are delegated, based on section 5.1.
   *   **capability:** Defines the capability itself:
       *   **type:** The type of capability, as defined in Section 6.2. This MUST be a URI that resolves to a definition of the capability type.
       *   **actions:**  An array of actions permitted by this capability (e.g., "read", "write").
       *   **target:** A URI identifying the resource to which the
           capability applies.
       *   **scope:** Further limits or expands on which targets may be accessible. For example, limiting a specific read capability to particular filetypes, even if the `target` is general. This can be a blank field as well, to just utilize the `target` parameter instead.
   *   **constraints:**  An optional array of constraints on the
       capability. Constraints can be used to limit the time, location,
       or other contextual factors under which the capability can be
       exercised. They contain the following keys:
       *   **type:** Defines the constraint mechanism used, e.g. timed, count, etc. Standard constraint types MUST be defined (e.g., `temporal`, `spatial`, `resource_limit`, `rate_limit`).
       *   **parameters:** Further expands on any necessary metadata associated with that particular type, such as what the `expiration` is set to on a timed capability, e.g. "expiration": "ISO8601_timestamp". The structure of `parameters` MUST be defined for each constraint type.

   *   **proof:** Metadata relating to providing proof that the delegated capabilities have not been tampered with.
       *   **type:** The method for generating the security `proof`.
       *   **created:** An ISO8601 timestamp for when the proof was generated.
       *   **verificationMethod:** The unique identifier of the agent delegating these capabilities. This URI MUST resolve to the public key needed to verify the proof.
       *   **proofPurpose:** The intended purpose of this proof, for logging. This can be `capabilityDelegation` or `assertionMethod`.
       *   **proofValue:** The security proof itself, which includes a signed copy of the capability token using the `verificationMethod` to do so.

   Implementations MAY define additional claims as needed.

### 6.2. Capability Types and Actions

   SHIELD defines the following standard capability types:

   *   **EXECUTE:** Allows execution of specific operations or code.
       Permitted actions include `execute_code`, `execute_query`,
       `execute_function`, `execute_workflow`. Possible constraints include: `resource_limits`, `runtime_environment`.

   *   **READ:**  Allows reading data from a resource. Permitted actions
       include `read_file`, `read_stream`, `read_database`, `read_memory`.
       Possible constraints include: `data_classification`, `access_time`.

   *   **WRITE:**  Allows modifying a resource. Permitted actions include
       `write_file`, `write_stream`, `write_database`, `modify_memory`.
       Possible constraints include: `data_volume`, `rate_limit`.

   *   **DELEGATE:** Allows delegating capabilities to other agents.
       Permitted actions include `delegate_capability`, `revoke_capability`,
       `modify_capability`. Possible constraints include: `delegation_depth`,
       `time_limit`.

   *   **COMMUNICATE:** Allows establishing communication channels and
       sending messages. Permitted actions include `establish_channel`,
       `send_message`, `broadcast_message`. Possible constraints
       include: `bandwidth_limit`, `recipient_scope`.

   *   **SANDBOX:** Allows creating and managing sandboxes. Permitted
       actions include `create_sandbox`, `modify_sandbox`, `transfer_agent`.
       Possible constraints include: `resource_quota`, `isolation_level`.

   Implementations MAY define additional capability types as needed.
   Implementations MUST only use specified types to ensure a common set of expectations are used during channel negotiations as defined in section 5.1. Each capability type MUST have a well-defined set of actions and constraints.

### 6.3. Delegation Chain

   Capabilities can be delegated from one agent to another. The
   delegation chain is tracked through the `parentCapability` and proof mechanisms.

   *   Each delegation step MUST create a new capability token.
   *   The `invoker` of a delegated capability becomes the
       `controller` of the new capability token.
   *   The `proof` section will be used to track the history of the capability, based on methods outlined in 6.1.

   Agents MUST verify the entire delegation chain before accepting a
   capability token. Agents will also verify that this follows a least-privilege model. The verification process MUST include:

   1. **Signature Verification:** Verify the signature of each capability token in the chain.
   2. **Constraint Checks:** Ensure that all constraints are satisfied at each delegation step.
   3. **Revocation Checks:** Check if any capability in the chain has been revoked.
   4. **Delegation Depth:** Verify that the delegation depth does not exceed the maximum allowed depth (if specified).
   5. **Least Privilege:** Ensure that each delegation step adheres to the principle of least privilege.

## 7. Sandbox Security

### 7.1. Secure Agent Runtime (SAR)

   The Secure Agent Runtime (SAR) is a critical component within each
   sandbox that enforces security policies and manages agent execution.
   The SAR MUST:

   *   **Enforce Capability-Based Access Control:** The SAR MUST verify
       and enforce the capabilities presented by agents before allowing
       any action.
   *   **Resource Isolation:** The SAR MUST ensure that agents within a
       sandbox are isolated from each other and from the host system.
       This includes memory isolation, file system isolation, and
       network isolation. The SAR MUST use OS-level mechanisms like namespaces and cgroups to achieve isolation. For network isolation, the SAR MUST isolate the network namespace and control network access through a virtual network interface.
   *   **Code Verification:** Before executing any agent code, the SAR
       MUST verify its integrity and authenticity using the mechanisms
       described in Section 7.2.
   *   **Secure Communication:** The SAR MUST mediate all communication
       between agents within the sandbox and between the sandbox and
       the external environment. All communication MUST use the secure
       channel protocols defined in Section 5.
   *   **Audit Logging:** The SAR MUST log all security-relevant events
       to the Audit Chain, as defined in Section 8.
   *   **Implement the Cross-Sandbox Protocol (XSP):** The SAR MUST
       support the XSP for secure agent transfer, as defined in
       Section 7.3.
   *   **Remote Attestation:** The SAR SHOULD support remote attestation to allow other entities to verify the security of the sandbox environment. The attestation report MUST be generated by a trusted component (e.g., a TPM or a secure enclave) and MUST include measurements of the SAR itself, the agent code, and the sandbox configuration.

   **SAR Configuration (`SARConfig`):**

   The SAR's behavior is governed by a configuration (`SARConfig`) that defines the security policies for the sandbox. The `SARConfig` MUST be cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.

       }
   }

       *   **seccomp_profile:** A base64 encoded seccomp profile that defines the allowed system calls.
       *   **capabilities:**  A list of Linux capabilities to grant to the agent.

   *   **resources:**
       *   **cpu_limit:** The maximum CPU time (in milliseconds) that the agent can consume.
       *   **memory_limit:** The maximum amount of memory (in bytes) that the agent can use.
       *   **storage_limit:** The maximum amount of storage (in bytes) that the agent can use. This can be further divided into `persistent` and `temporary` storage.
       *   **network_quota:** The maximum network bandwidth (in bytes per second) that the agent can use. This can be further divided into `ingress` and `egress` quotas.

   *   **security_policy:**
       *   **syscall_allowlist:** A list of system calls that the agent is allowed to make.
       *   **network_policy:**
           *   **allowed_endpoints:** A list of endpoints (domains or IP ranges) that the agent is allowed to communicate with.
           *   **allowed_protocols:** A list of protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP) that the agent is allowed to use.

### 7.2. Code Verification

   To prevent the execution of malicious or compromised code, the SAR
   MUST perform code verification before executing any agent code. The
   verification process involves:

   1. **Signature Verification:** The agent code MUST be digitally
       signed using a NIST-approved post-quantum signature algorithm.
       The SAR MUST verify the signature using the corresponding public
       key from the agent's AgentID.
   2. **Integrity Check:** The SAR MUST compute a cryptographic hash
       of the agent code and compare it with a trusted hash value, if
       available. This ensures that the code has not been tampered with
       during transit or storage.
   3. **Policy Enforcement:** The SAR MUST check the agent code
       against a set of predefined security policies. These policies
       can define restrictions on the agent's behavior, such as
       resource usage limits, network access restrictions, and
       prohibited operations.

   If any of these verification steps fail, the SAR MUST NOT execute
   the agent code and MUST log the event to the Audit Chain.

   **Code Verification Techniques:**

   The SAR MAY employ a combination of static and runtime verification techniques:

   *   **Static Analysis:**
       *   The SAR MAY perform static analysis of the agent code to detect potential security vulnerabilities before execution.
       *   Static analysis tools can identify issues such as buffer overflows, use of unsafe functions, and violations of coding standards.
       *   The SAR SHOULD use a combination of different static analysis tools to increase coverage.

   *   **Runtime Verification:**
       *   The SAR MAY instrument the agent code to perform runtime checks during execution.
       *   Runtime checks can enforce memory safety, control flow integrity, and other security properties.
       *   The SAR MAY use techniques like sandboxing, virtualization, or dynamic binary instrumentation to implement runtime verification.

### 7.3. Cross-Sandbox Protocol (XSP)

   The Cross-Sandbox Protocol (XSP) enables the secure transfer of
   agents between different sandboxing environments. XSP MUST ensure
   the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the transferred
   agent and its associated state. The protocol consists of the
   following steps:

   1. **Negotiation:** The source and destination SARs establish a
       secure channel using the protocols defined in Section 5. They
       negotiate the transfer parameters, including the agent to be
       transferred, the destination sandbox, and any required
       capabilities. The destination SAR advertises its capabilities and security level. The source SAR verifies that the destination meets the agent's requirements.
   2. **State Serialization:** The source SAR serializes the agent's
       state, including its memory, registers, and any other relevant
       data. The serialized state MUST be encrypted and authenticated
       using a NIST-approved post-quantum encryption algorithm.
   3. **Agent Code Transfer:** The source SAR transfers the agent's
       code to the destination SAR. The code MUST be verified using the
       mechanisms described in Section 7.2.
   4. **State Transfer:** The source SAR transfers the encrypted and
       authenticated agent state to the destination SAR.
   5. **State Deserialization:** The destination SAR decrypts and
       authenticates the agent state. It then deserializes the state
       and loads it into the agent's new execution environment.
   6. **Verification:** The destination SAR verifies the integrity and
       authenticity of the transferred agent and its state. The destination SAR performs remote attestation to prove its security to the source SAR before the transfer begins.
   7. **Activation:** The destination SAR activates the transferred
       agent within the new sandbox.

   If any of these steps fail, the transfer MUST be aborted, and the
   event MUST be logged to the Audit Chain.

   **XSP Message Format (`SandboxTransfer`):**

   Implementations MAY define additional event types as needed.

### 8.3. Audit Chain

   The Audit Chain MUST be implemented as an append-only,
   cryptographically linked data structure. Each new audit record MUST
   be linked to the previous record by including the hash of the
   previous record in the new record's `data` field. This creates a
   chain of records that is tamper-evident: any attempt to modify or
   delete a record will break the chain and be immediately detectable.

   The Audit Chain MUST be protected from unauthorized access and
   modification. Implementations SHOULD use a combination of access
   controls, encryption, and secure storage mechanisms to ensure the
   confidentiality and integrity of the Audit Chain.

   The Audit Chain MAY be distributed across multiple nodes or systems
   to improve its resilience and availability. In such cases, a
   consensus mechanism MUST be used to ensure the consistency and
   integrity of the distributed Audit Chain.

   **Merkle Tree Structure:**

   The Audit Chain SHOULD be organized as a Merkle tree to provide efficient verification of the integrity of individual audit records and the entire chain. Each block in the chain contains a Merkle root of the audit records in that block.

   ```
   {
       "root_hash": "base64_encoded_hash",
       "tree_size": "uint64",
       "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp",
       "block": {
           "sequence": "uint64",
           "records": ["Array<AuditRecord>"],
           "previous_hash": "base64_encoded_hash",
           "merkle_root": "base64_encoded_hash"
       },
       "consistency_proof": "Array<base64_encoded_hash>",
       "signature": {
           "algorithm": "String",
           "value": "base64_encoded_signature",
           "key_id": "String (Fingerprint or URI)"
       }
   }
   ```

   *   **root_hash:** The root hash of the Merkle tree.
   *   **tree_size:** The total number of records in the tree.
   *   **timestamp:** The timestamp of the block.
   *   **block:**
       *   **sequence:** The block sequence number.
       *   **records:** An array of audit records included in the block.
       *   **previous_hash:** The hash of the previous block's header.
       *   **merkle_root:** The Merkle root of the audit records in the block.
   *   **consistency_proof:** A cryptographic proof that the current block is consistent with previous blocks.
   *   **signature:** A digital signature over the block header, signed by a trusted entity responsible for maintaining the Audit Chain.

   **Storage:** The audit chain blocks can be stored in a dedicated database, on a blockchain, in a distributed file system, or using other suitable storage mechanisms.

   **Verification:** The integrity of the audit chain can be verified by:

   1. Checking the signature of each block.
   2. Verifying the Merkle root of each block.
   3. Verifying the consistency proof between consecutive blocks.
   4. Checking that the `previous_hash` of each block matches the hash of the previous block's header.

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1. Threat Model

   SHIELD is designed to address the following threats:

   *   **Malicious Agents:** Agents that attempt to gain unauthorized
       access to resources, disrupt the system, or exfiltrate data.

       that all interactions are continuously authenticated and
       authorized, reducing the impact of compromised agents or insider
       threats.
   *   **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:** The use of NIST-approved
       post-quantum algorithms protects against quantum computer
       attacks.
   *   **Capability-Based Access Control:** Fine-grained, capability-
       based access control limits the damage that can be caused by
       malicious or compromised agents.
   *   **Secure Sandboxing:** Sandboxing isolates agent execution and
       prevents unauthorized access to system resources.
   *   **Code Verification:** Code verification ensures that only
       trusted and unmodified code is executed.
   *   **Secure Channels:** Secure channels protect the confidentiality,
       integrity, and authenticity of inter-agent communications.
   *   **Audit Chain:** The Audit Chain provides a tamper-evident record
       of all security-relevant events, enabling detection of attacks
       and facilitating incident response.

   critical security incidents, such as the compromise of a root CA or
   a widespread system failure. These procedures should include:

   *   **Agent Revocation:** Mechanisms for revoking compromised or
       malicious agents. This may involve updating the agent revocation
       list and propagating the updates to all relevant systems.
   *   **Key Compromise Recovery:** Procedures for recovering from the
       compromise of cryptographic keys. This may involve generating
       new keys, updating key stores, and re-establishing secure
       channels.
   *   **System Rollback:** Mechanisms for rolling back the system to a
       previous secure state in the event of a catastrophic failure or
       a widespread compromise.

       sandboxing technologies, such as containers (e.g., Docker),
       virtual machines (e.g., KVM, Xen), or specialized sandboxing
       frameworks.
   *   **Hardware Security:** Implementations SHOULD leverage hardware
       security features, such as TPMs, HSMs, and secure enclaves,
       where available.
   *   **Testing:** Implementations MUST undergo rigorous security
       testing, including penetration testing, fuzzing, and formal
       verification, where applicable.
   *   **Code Reviews:** All code MUST undergo thorough security-focused
       code reviews before being deployed.

   **Required Components:**

   *   **Cryptography:**
       *   **Library:**  `liboqs`, `Open Quantum Safe`, or other libraries providing NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms.

       transition to a NIST-approved post-quantum algorithm is
       recommended when available)
   *   **Message Authentication Code (MAC):**  HMAC-SHA3-256

   **Algorithm Selection Criteria:**

   *   Algorithms MUST be selected from the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.
   *   Algorithms MUST be considered secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers.
   *   Algorithms MUST have undergone thorough cryptanalysis and public review.
   *   Algorithms SHOULD have efficient implementations available in software and/or hardware.

   **Deprecation Policy:**

   *   Cryptographic algorithms and বাস্তবায়িত protocols MAY be deprecated over time as new vulnerabilities are discovered or stronger alternatives become available.
   *   A deprecation plan MUST be announced at least one year in advance of an algorithm or protocol being deprecated.
   *   The deprecation plan MUST include a timeline for transitioning to new algorithms or protocols.
   *   Deprecated algorithms and protocols MUST NOT be used in new deployments.
   *   Existing deployments SHOULD transition to new algorithms or protocols as soon as practical.

   Implementations MUST be prepared to transition to new NIST-approved
   post-quantum algorithms as they become available.

       "message": "String",
       "details": "Map<String, Any>",
       "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp"
   }
   ```

   *   **code:** A numeric error code.
   *   **message:** A human-readable error message.
   *   **details:**  An optional map containing additional information about the error.
   *   **timestamp:** An ISO8601 timestamp indicating when the error occurred.

   Implementations MAY define additional error codes as needed.

**Error Handling:**

*   Agents SHOULD handle errors gracefully and take appropriate action based on the error code.
*   Errors SHOULD be logged to the Audit Chain, including the error code, message, and any relevant details.
*   Sensitive information (e.g., cryptographic keys, private data) MUST NOT be included in error messages or audit logs.
